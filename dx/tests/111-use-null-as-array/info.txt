This is a smoke test of dex conversion, which checks to see that uses
of a known-null in contexts that require a specific type end up getting
converted to the type in question. When executed, this sort of code
will inevitably throw a NullPointerException, but if the opcode weren't
correct, they would instead incorrectly fail verification.

This test compares emitted code against a known-good (via eyeballing)
version, so it is possible for this test to spuriously fail if other
aspects of conversion end up altering the output in innocuous ways.
