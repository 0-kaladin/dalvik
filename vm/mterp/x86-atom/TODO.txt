Items requiring attention:

(hi) Add gc card marking to aput/iput/sput/new_filled_array
(hi) Correct stack overflow handling (dvmCleanupStackOverflow takes an
     additional argument now)
(hi) "debugger active" test in common_periodicChecks must handle
     the case where glue->pDebuggerActive is a NULL pointer (used to
     skip a memory load when debugger support is completely disabled)
(hi) WITH_DEBUGGER and WITH_PROFILER are no longer defined (but are
     assumed to be enabled)
(hi) Add implementations for jumbo opcodes (40 instructions)
(hi) Implement OP_DISPATCH_FF for real. (Right now it's treated as
     an unused instruction.)

(md) Correct OP_MONITOR_EXIT (need to adjust PC before throw)
(md) OP_THROW needs to export the PC
(md) Use dvmThrowAIOOBE(index, length) for array bounds errors.
(md) Use dvmThrowClassCastException(actual, desired) for class cast errors.
(md) Use dvmThrowArrayStoreException(actual, desired) for array store errors.

(lo) Implement OP_BREAKPOINT
(lo) Implement OP_EXECUTE_INLINE_RANGE
(lo) Implement OP_*_VOLATILE (12 instructions)
(lo) Implement OP_RETURN_VOID_BARRIER
